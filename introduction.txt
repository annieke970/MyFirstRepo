Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Hannah, and I am currently learning how to use Git and GitHub as part of my ALX learning tasks. I enjoy improving my digital skills and exploring new areas in technology. I’m excited to continue learning and building projects.

I look forward to gaining more experience, collaborating on different tasks, and becoming confident with version control using GitHub.
